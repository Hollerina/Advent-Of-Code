Advent of Code is a yearly event which begins on Decemeber 1st it is a countdown until Christmas Day where each day a new puzzle is released with 2 parts too it. You can use any language you want all you have to do is make sure you get the right answer. My goal is to complete all the years I have missed and have a full set of solutions.

<p>This year the story involves helping the elves making it snow on snow island again. Where the journey leads us to new islands to create the snow. There was a variety of problems involved with the most noticable being grid searching. This year as a challenge I decided to change the language I used every 2 days giving me a total of 13 languages with the majority of these I haven't done before. I decided to take on this challenge because I wanted to push myself to try something new. It also put to the test on my ability to quikly pick up new languages. I have enjoyed learning a variety of these Languages the most challenging one I have used so far has been C.</p>
